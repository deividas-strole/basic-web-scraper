# Basic Web Scraper — Java Learning Project by Deividas Strole

**Basic Web Scraper** is a simple Java-based learning project that demonstrates how to build a basic web crawler. This scraper visits a starting URL, finds the first hyperlink on the page, logs it, and then follows that link repeatedly until it encounters a page it cannot access (e.g., requiring login or blocked).

This project was created by **Deividas Strole** as a beginner-friendly exercise in Java programming, networking, and HTML parsing. It’s a great starting point for developers learning about HTTP requests, recursion, and simple web navigation logic.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Visits a website URL  
- Finds the first link on each page  
- Logs the link it follows  
- Repeats until it cannot access a page  
- Stops when a page cannot be reached or parsed

This illustrates fundamentals of **web crawling**, simple **HTTP interaction**, and basic HTML traversal.

---

## 📌 Features

- Sequential link traversal
- Logging of visited pages
- Simple stopping condition for inaccessible pages
- Minimal dependencies for ease of learning

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** — Core language
- **HTTP connections** — Built-in Java networking APIs
- **Maven** — Project build and dependency management
- **jsoup** (optional) — Suggested for HTML parsing (if used)

---

📖 Learning Goals

- This repository is designed for developers who want to:
- Understand basic web scraping principles
- Learn how HTTP requests work in Java
- See simple recursion/iteration in action for crawling
- Practice reading and processing HTML content

It is **not intended for production scraping** of large or dynamic websites — only for educational purposes.
